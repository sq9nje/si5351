Si5351 Arduino Library
======================

This is a simple Arduino library for the Si5351 clock generator chip. The code is at a very basic stage at the moment, however it is already usable. All testing is done on the 3 output MSOP packaged version of the chip and this is the only version that will be fully supported, however extension for other versions of the IC is possible in the future. The development focus is on applications in HAM radio equipment and RF.
